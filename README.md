# Berkeley-Pacman-Projects
# Pacman-Simulation

üéÆüïπÔ∏èüëæ Created a Pacman simulation in Python as part of UC Berkeley‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence course. The project is divided into two parts: a basic agent using search algorithms, and a more advanced multiagent system.

### Part 1: Search

In this part, the Pacman agent navigates mazes to reach specific locations and collect food efficiently. General search algorithms were implemented and applied to various Pacman scenarios.

**Algorithms implemented:**

- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search

For detailed explanations, refer to the analytical instructions.

### Part 2: Multiagents

This part focuses on designing intelligent agents for the classic Pacman game, including ghosts.

**Key algorithms implemented:**

- Minimax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Expectimax

Additionally, experimented with evaluation function design to enhance agent performance.

### Additional Concepts

- Reflex Agent
- Minimax behavior and decision-making
- Alpha-Beta pruning optimizations
- Expectimax algorithm
- Evaluation function design and tuning
